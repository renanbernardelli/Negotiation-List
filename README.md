# Negotiation-List
📝 Negotiations list under construction based on the Proxy and Factory pattern :triangular_ruler:

## What is it?

That is an immutable list of negotiation 🔒  in which is possible to record data and to get the logs of them.

## How does it work?

The negotiation list receives a date, quantity and value of negotiation. 💾
The list can not be changed or deleted, it can only delete the display on the screen.

## How am I developing that?

Its architecture MVC make me organize each function on its respective file, trying to follow the SOLID principles.🔆
To make this possible, I've used defensive programming and I've chosen two of the most used pattern now a day (Proxy and Factory).
This small, but complex and useful project is under construction. 👷
